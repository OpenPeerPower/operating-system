Subject: [PATCH 2/3] ARM: DTS: rk3288-tinker: Defining the SPI interface

Taken from, and tested by @TonyMac32 .

Well, the original one was tested by him but I had to adapt the
registers definitions to the new 64-bits LPAE-compliant syntax.

Therefore that *might* break, along with a few other patches.
